# Endless Battle Changes
## New in version 0.0.2 (build 2024.10.19)
* You can now press F1 on each store item to get its description.
* Fixed speech interrupting in menus, especially with Android having speech interrupt on. On Android if you want to force speech stop while you're in game play, triple tap with 1 finger.
* Fixed enemy death sound not playing in the correct listener.
* You can now click on "get system information" icon in the main menu to get information related to system, including its information and necessary debug logs. Only do this when it's necessary, for example if you asked a question related to device issue, so developer might need to ask you that information; only provide it when it is asked! The information you retrieved is encrypted, meaning only developers can extract its information, adding another possible security implementations to each information that you provide. This also means that even if the information is published publicly to the internet, no one will be able to access its original form.
* Decreased jump time a bit.
* Improved store related text strings.
* Information of the weapons have been removed from the weapon draw menu. Instead, you will have to press F1 to read the weapon's related information while you're at it.
* You can now rotate 90 degrees by pressing turn keys (Q and E) while holding down Shift. This 90 degrees rotation is not currently available by touch.
* In-game key shortcuts can now display base on the operating system!
* Added pluralization strings to items, for instance, store purchases.

## New in version 0.0.1 (build 2024.10.13)
* First release
