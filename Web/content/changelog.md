* You can now press F1 on each store item to get its description.

* Fixed enemy death sound not playing in the correct listener.
* You can now click on "get system information" icon in the main menu to get information related to system, including its information and necessary debug logs. Only do this when it's necessary, for example if you asked a question related to device issue, so developer might need to ask you that information; only provide it when it is asked! The information you retrieved is encrypted, meaning only developers can extract its information, adding another possible security implementations to each information that you provide. This also means that even if the information is published publicly to the internet, no one will be able to access its original form.
