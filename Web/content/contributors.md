* [Sam Tupy](https://samtupy.com/): Provider of NVGT, the game engine this game is used.
* [GitHub](https://github.com): Website host, for public contributions, as well as private repository for source code keeping for the purposes of backup and collaborative contributions.
* [Zola](https://getzola.org): A static site generator written in Rust, which helped generating this website way easy than having manually writing down much HTML/JS, with the ability to use themes of my own.
