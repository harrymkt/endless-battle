You can contribute translations by forking

## Contributing

2. Clone your forked repository,
```
https://github.com/<your_username>/Endless Battle.git
```
Replace <your_username> with your github username.

3. Make changes in your forked repository.
4. Make a poll request. For translations, the name of the author as well as contact link would be helpful in the description section of the pull request. Also, make sure to set flag and code for your translation files.

That's it!

## translation
To translate, you don't need any programming structure. Copy the template_lang.lng and put it into the lang folder.

Next, rename the template_lang.lng in the lang folder to the name of your translation language, with the first character being possible capital, eg Burmese.

### Placeholders
To dynamically change the values, we used Placeholders. Placeholders are surrounded by left and right braces, `{}`, and numbers as variables.

For example, `You have {1} dollars`.

`{1}` is the variable used to replace the amount of dollars you have.
